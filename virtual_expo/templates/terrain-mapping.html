                <h3>PROBLEM STATEMENT: </h3>
                <p>To construct a 3D map of the immediate environment from a ground-based
                    rover using depth cameras mounted on it.
                </p>


                <h3>PROPOSED SOLUTION:</h3>
                <p>A Digital Terrain Model (DTM) constructed using the sensor
                    data from the Microsoft Kinect sensor in real time which can then be remotely
                    accessed from any system. The Ground bot is expected to move at a speed of upto
                    1m/s to allow time for the Kinect to collect data and for the RPi to compute and
                    store this data. ROS’ RTabMap package is to be used to create the model.
                </p>


                <h3>TECHNOLOGY USED</h3>
                <p>Raspberry Pi 4, Kinect V1, ROS
                </p>



                <h3>RESULTS</h3>
                <p>Setting up the Kinect, a Digital Terrain Model was obtained using the
                    same. Kinect Sensor data of a test run was compiled and the resulting map
                    analyzed for errors in accuracy. The updated algorithm has not yet been tested on
                    the bot.<br>
                    

                </p>


                <h3>FUTURE WORK</h3>
                <p>● If a Survey can be conducted among thousands of people which takes note of the current
                    movie they would prefer to watch along with the reason “Why” and take a snapshot of the
                    person. Using this dataset along with word embedding conduct a sentiment analysis, and
                    then train the current CNN architecture on those emotions based on the results of the
                    sentiment analysis. This would be a more accurate representation of a movie
                    recommender<br>
                    ● We’ve observed that there were certain misclassifications such as persons with glasses
                    being classified as “angry”. This happens since the label “angry” is highly activated when
                    it believes a person is frowning and frowning features get confused with darker glass
                    frames. This leads to bias in the machine learning process. We believe that uncovering
                    such behaviours is of extreme importance when creating robust classifiers, and that the
                    use of the visualization techniques such as guided back-propagation will become
                    invaluable when uncovering model biases.<br>
