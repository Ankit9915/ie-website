                <h3>PROBLEM STATEMENT: </h3>
                <p>The primary purpose of this project was to study how the organization of OPEC and its policies
                    has influenced the world economy in the past and the present. We wanted to show how OPEC
                    and the oil economy can cause huge changes to the world economy. This was a research
                    based project.
                </p>

                <h3>METHODOLOGY:</h3>
                <p>
                    We went through various research papers and published data to gather various facts. We studied
                    various graphs and trends to make sense of the changes in the world economy due to alteration
                    of OPEC policies. We had to make few changes to our project with respect to the latest issues
                    regarding OPEC policies.
                </p>



                <h3>RESULTS</h3>
                <p>It has helped us understand how the world economy can be influenced heavily by an important
                    commodity such as oil. It helped us understand the importance of a governing body to monitor
                    policies with respect to petroleum. We also understood tensions between various countries with
                    respect to issues involving petroleum.


                </p>


                <h3>FUTURE WORK</h3>
                <p>The future is to obtain more data regarding the oil producing nations with a further step of adding
                    a mathematical model and trying to predict the futures market of oil as a commodity and how it
                    will affect the economic status of the world economy.
                </p>

                <h3>KEY LEARNINGS</h3>
                <p>We learnt a great deal on the organization called OPEC and its member nations and how each
                    member nation has a share in the oil market. We also learnt key aspects influence these oil
                    producing nations have on the world economy. Concluding with a learning of what holds in the
                    future of OPEC and the oil market.
                </p>


                <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
                <p>We got to understand how oil is such an important commodity in determining the economic
                    status of the world and how a fluctuation in the value of oil can leverage a lot of factors in the
                    world.
