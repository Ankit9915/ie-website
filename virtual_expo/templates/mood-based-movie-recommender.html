                <h3>PROBLEM STATEMENT: </h3>
                <p>To Design a General Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) building framework for designing real-
                    time CNNs. The real time CNN should be trained and designed to predict human emotions and

                    predict movies based on those emotions.
                </p>


                <h3>PROPOSED SOLUTION:</h3>
                <p>We used Depthwise Separable Convolution Neural Networks and built a miniature version of
                    Xception Architecture which was proposed by Francois Chollet, the founder of Keras. The
                    architecture has already been used in certain research references. These CNNs were trained on
                    the FER-2013 Dataset, which had the following classes {“angry”, “disgust”, “fear”, “happy”, “sad”,
                    “surprise”, “neutral”}. We used OpenCV to get the Region of Interest (ROI) from the real-time feed
                    and sent it to the trained min-Xception model for classification. We turned down the number of
                    classes to the basic 4 emotions {“Happy”, “Sad”, “Neutral”, “Angry”} and assigned some movies
                    subjectively to each category. A Web Application was developed to host the whole project. Web
                    Application was built using the Python-Flask framework. It Integrates the prediction model to
                    serve the recommended movies to the user. It asks the user for a real-time snapshot, which is
                    then passed to the model in the back-end. List of Movies is extracted from the Database based
                    on the results produced by the model.
                </p>


                <h3>TECHNOLOGY USED</h3>
                <p>Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Pandas, SciKit_Learn, NumPy, Flask ,HTML, CSS, BootStrap,
                    MySQL
                </p>




                <h3>METHODOLOGY</h3>
                <p>1. Our focus was on building a basic face detection program in OpenCV using Haar
                    Cascades for the beginning phase. Initially, the algorithm needs a lot of positive images
                    (images with faces) and negative images (images without faces) to train the classifier
                    which is very similar to convolutional kernel. We used the default
                    haarcascade_frontal_face_default.xml .<br>
                    2. Once our basic building block was done. We diverted our attention on building a
                    Convolutional Neural Network for training and also on finding a dataset that contains
                    huge amounts of images.<br>
                    3. For the Dataset, we found the FER-2013 dataset which was used in Facial Expression
                    Recognition Kaggle Contest. It contained 35,685 images of 48 x 48 pixels.<br>
                    4. After doing some brainstorming and learning about CNNs we found that DepthWise
                    Separable CNNs were more better in classifying images and also reduces overfitting of
                    the training data.<br>
                    5. We found a relevant architecture called “Xception Architecture” which was developed by
                    Google Researchers published under the name of Francois Chollet, creator of Keras.<br>
                    6. The XCeption Deep Neural Network Model was too expensive to train with the
                    computational power we had access to. So we decided to implement a miniature version
                    of this min-XCeption whose architecture was quite elementary and also had citations.<br>
                    7. Our final architecture is a fully-convolutional neural network that contains 4 residual
                    depth-wise separable convolutions where each convolution is followed by a batch
                    normalization operation and a ReLU activation function.<br>
                    8. This architecture has approximately 60, 000 parameters; which corresponds to a
                    reduction of 80× when compared to a original CNN.<br>
                    9. We introduced batch normalization, to address the problem of Internal Covariate Shift,
                    for much higher training rates, and helped achieving 14 times fewer training steps with
                    the same accuracy.<br>
                    10. We carried out real-time detection of emotions on the trained model. Our application
                    gave the percentage of each emotional class.<br>
                    11. Our next target was to build a Web Application, which had all of the programs running in
                    the backend. The Web App had the following functionalities taking real time snapshots of
                    person, detection of emotion, displaying the resultant emotion and a list of movies which
                    were subjectively assigned to each emotion and stored in a MySQL database.<br>
                    12. Everytime a emotion was called, a random list of movies from the corresponding emotion
                    is displayed on the web app.<br>
                </p>

                <h3>RESULTS</h3>
                <p>● Our miniature implementation of the XCeption Architecture performed pretty well on the
                    FER-2013 dataset with about 74 % accuracy after 56 Epochs<br>
                    ● The architecture reduces the parameters by 80x while obtaining favourable results by
                    using depth wise separable convolution neural networks.<br>
                </p>

                <h3>FUTURE WORK</h3>
                <p>● If a Survey can be conducted among thousands of people which takes note of the current
                    movie they would prefer to watch along with the reason “Why” and take a snapshot of the
                    person. Using this dataset along with word embedding conduct a sentiment analysis, and
                    then train the current CNN architecture on those emotions based on the results of the
                    sentiment analysis. This would be a more accurate representation of a movie
                    recommender<br>
                    ● We’ve observed that there were certain misclassifications such as persons with glasses
                    being classified as “angry”. This happens since the label “angry” is highly activated when
                    it believes a person is frowning and frowning features get confused with darker glass
                    frames. This leads to bias in the machine learning process. We believe that uncovering
                    such behaviours is of extreme importance when creating robust classifiers, and that the
                    use of the visualization techniques such as guided back-propagation will become
                    invaluable when uncovering model biases.<br>
