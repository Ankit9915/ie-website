    ,"Description":"Semantic search seeks to improve search accuracy by understanding a searcherâ€™s intent through contextual meaning. The  attempts to train a visual recognition model using labeled images as well as semantic information from text data. Will use textual data to learn semantic relationships between labels and map images into a semantic embedding space."
