    ,"Description":"Identification of various kinds of corrosion in  domestic solar water heater tank which lead to the severe damage and leakage of water. Given pictures ,SEM images of failed sections, composition and properties of tank material and water report  were analysed to identify the corrosion type.\nApplication of theory was done to  understand and finalise the reason for corrosion.\nAnsys simulation was used to confirm the reasons for certain  regions of tank  prone to corrosion."
